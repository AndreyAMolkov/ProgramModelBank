Servlets Interview Questions  
Q1. What is a servlet?
*	Java Servlet is server side technologies to extend the capability of web servers 
by providing support for dynamic response and data persistence.
*	The javax.servlet and javax.servlet.http packages provide interfaces and classes 
for writing our own servlets.
*	All servlets must implement the javax.servlet.Servlet interface, which defines 
servlet lifecycle methods. When implementing a generic service, we can extend 
the GenericServlet class provided with the Java Servlet API. The HttpServlet 
class provides methods, such as doGet() and doPost(), for handling HTTP-
specific services.
*	Most of the times, web applications are accessed using HTTP protocol and thats 
why we mostly extend HttpServlet class. Servlet API hierarchy is shown in below 
image.

Q2. What are the differences between Get and Post methods?
Get - Limited amount of data can be sent because data is sent in header. Not Secured 
because data is exposed in URL bar.  Can be bookmarked.  Idempotent.  It is more 
efficient and used than Post
Post - Large amount of data can be sent because data is sent in body. Secured 
because data is not exposed in URL bar. Cannot be bookmarked. Non-Idempotent. It is 
less efficient and used
Q3. What is Request Dispatcher?
RequestDispatcher interface is used to forward the request to another resource that can 
be HTML, JSP or another servlet in same application. We can also use this to include 
the content of another resource to the response.
There are two methods defined in this interface:
1.void forward()
2.void include()
Q4. What are the differences between forward() method and 
sendRedirect() methods?
Forward() method - forward() sends the same request to another resource. 
forward() method works at server side. forward() method works within the server only.
SendRedirect() method - sendRedirect() method sends new request always 
because it uses the URL bar of the browser. sendRedirect() method works at client side. 
sendRedirect() method works within and outside the server.
Q5. What is the life-cycle of a servlet?
There are 5 stages in the lifecycle of a servlet:
1.	Servlet is loaded
2.	Servlet is instantiated
3.	Servlet is initialized
4.	Service the request
5.	Servlet is destroyed
Q6. How does cookies work in Servlets?
*	Cookies are text data sent by server to the client and it gets saved at the client 
local machine.
*	Servlet API provides cookies support through javax.servlet.http.Cookie class that 
implements Serializable and Cloneable interfaces.
*	HttpServletRequest getCookies() method is provided to get the array of Cookies 
from request, since there is no point of adding Cookie to request, there are no 
methods to set or add cookie to request.
*	Similarly HttpServletResponse addCookie(Cookie c) method is provided to attach 
cookie in response header, there are no getter methods for cookie.
Q7. What are the differences between ServletContext vs ServletConfig?
The difference between ServletContext and ServletConfig in Servlets JSP is in below 
tabular format.
ServletConfig - Servlet config object represent single servlet. Its like local 
parameter associated with particular servlet. It's a name value pair defined inside the 
servlet section of web.xml file so it has servlet wide scope. getServletConfig() method is 
used to get the config object. for example shopping cart of a user is a specific to 
particular user so here we can use servlet config.
ServletContext - It represent whole web application running on particular JVM and 
common for all the servlet. Its like global parameter associated with whole application. 
ServletContext has application wide scope so define outside of servlet tag in web.xml 
file. getServletContext() method is  used to get the context object. To get the MIME type 
of a file or application session related information is stored using servlet context object
Q8. What are the different methods of session management in 
servlets?
Session is a conversational state between client and server and it can consists of 
multiple request and response between client and server. Since HTTP and Web Server 
both are stateless, the only way to maintain a session is when some unique information 
about the session (session id) is passed between server and client in every request and 
response.
Some of the common ways of session management in servlets are:
1.	User Authentication
2.	HTML Hidden Field
3.	Cookies
4.	URL Rewriting
5.	Session Management API

Forward() method - forward() sends the same request to another resource. 
forward() method works at server side. forward() method works within the server only.
SendRedirect() method - sendRedirect() method sends new request always 
because it uses the URL bar of the browser. sendRedirect() method works at client side. 
sendRedirect() method works within and outside the server.
Q5. What is the life-cycle of a servlet?
There are 5 stages in the lifecycle of a servlet:
1.	Servlet is loaded
2.	Servlet is instantiated
3.	Servlet is initialized
4.	Service the request
5.	Servlet is destroyed
Q6. How does cookies work in Servlets?
*	Cookies are text data sent by server to the client and it gets saved at the client 
local machine.
*	Servlet API provides cookies support through javax.servlet.http.Cookie class that 
implements Serializable and Cloneable interfaces.
*	HttpServletRequest getCookies() method is provided to get the array of Cookies 
from request, since there is no point of adding Cookie to request, there are no 
methods to set or add cookie to request.
*	Similarly HttpServletResponse addCookie(Cookie c) method is provided to attach 
cookie in response header, there are no getter methods for cookie.
Q7. What are the differences between ServletContext vs ServletConfig?
The difference between ServletContext and ServletConfig in Servlets JSP is in below 
tabular format.
ServletConfig - Servlet config object represent single servlet. Its like local 
parameter associated with particular servlet. It's a name value pair defined inside the 
servlet section of web.xml file so it has servlet wide scope. getServletConfig() method is 
used to get the config object. for example shopping cart of a user is a specific to 
particular user so here we can use servlet config.
ServletContext - It represent whole web application running on particular JVM and 
common for all the servlet. Its like global parameter associated with whole application. 
ServletContext has application wide scope so define outside of servlet tag in web.xml 
file. getServletContext() method is  used to get the context object. To get the MIME type 
of a file or application session related information is stored using servlet context object
Q8. What are the different methods of session management in 
servlets?
Session is a conversational state between client and server and it can consists of 
multiple request and response between client and server. Since HTTP and Web Server 
both are stateless, the only way to maintain a session is when some unique information 
about the session (session id) is passed between server and client in every request and 
response.
Some of the common ways of session management in servlets are:
1.	User Authentication
2.	HTML Hidden Field
3.	Cookies
4.	URL Rewriting
5.	Session Management API































Servlets Interview Questions  
Q1. What is a servlet?
*	Java Servlet is server side technologies to extend the capability of web servers 
by providing support for dynamic response and data persistence.
*	The javax.servlet and javax.servlet.http packages provide interfaces and classes 
for writing our own servlets.
*	All servlets must implement the javax.servlet.Servlet interface, which defines 
servlet lifecycle methods. When implementing a generic service, we can extend 
the GenericServlet class provided with the Java Servlet API. The HttpServlet 
class provides methods, such as doGet() and doPost(), for handling HTTP-
specific services.
*	Most of the times, web applications are accessed using HTTP protocol and thats 
why we mostly extend HttpServlet class. Servlet API hierarchy is shown in below 
image.

Q2. What are the differences between Get and Post methods?
Get - Limited amount of data can be sent because data is sent in header. Not Secured 
because data is exposed in URL bar.  Can be bookmarked.  Idempotent.  It is more 
efficient and used than Post
Post - Large amount of data can be sent because data is sent in body. Secured 
because data is not exposed in URL bar. Cannot be bookmarked. Non-Idempotent. It is 
less efficient and used
Q3. What is Request Dispatcher?
RequestDispatcher interface is used to forward the request to another resource that can 
be HTML, JSP or another servlet in same application. We can also use this to include 
the content of another resource to the response.
There are two methods defined in this interface:
1.void forward()

servlet section of web.xml file so it has servlet wide scope. getServletConfig() method is 
used to get the config object. for example shopping cart of a user is a specific to 
particular user so here we can use servlet config.
ServletContext - It represent whole web application running on particular JVM and 
common for all the servlet. Its like global parameter associated with whole application. 
ServletContext has application wide scope so define outside of servlet tag in web.xml 
file. getServletContext() method is  used to get the context object. To get the MIME type 
of a file or application session related information is stored using servlet context object
Q8. What are the different methods of session management in 
servlets?
Session is a conversational state between client and server and it can consists of 
multiple request and response between client and server. Since HTTP and Web Server 
both are stateless, the only way to maintain a session is when some unique information 
about the session (session id) is passed between server and client in every request and 
response.
Some of the common ways of session management in servlets are:
1.	User Authentication
2.	HTML Hidden Field
3.	Cookies
4.	URL Rewriting
5.	Session Management API































Servlets Interview Questions  
Q1. What is a servlet?
*	Java Servlet is server side technologies to extend the capability of web servers 
by providing support for dynamic response and data persistence.
*	The javax.servlet and javax.servlet.http packages provide interfaces and classes 
for writing our own servlets.
*	All servlets must implement the javax.servlet.Servlet interface, which defines 
servlet lifecycle methods. When implementing a generic service, we can extend 
the GenericServlet class provided with the Java Servlet API. The HttpServlet 
class provides methods, such as doGet() and doPost(), for handling HTTP-
specific services.
*	Most of the times, web applications are accessed using HTTP protocol and thats 
why we mostly extend HttpServlet class. Servlet API hierarchy is shown in below 
image.

Q2. What are the differences between Get and Post methods?
Get - Limited amount of data can be sent because data is sent in header. Not Secured 
because data is exposed in URL bar.  Can be bookmarked.  Idempotent.  It is more 
efficient and used than Post
Post - Large amount of data can be sent because data is sent in body. Secured 
because data is not exposed in URL bar. Cannot be bookmarked. Non-Idempotent. It is 
less efficient and used
Q3. What is Request Dispatcher?
RequestDispatcher interface is used to forward the request to another resource that can 
be HTML, JSP or another servlet in same application. We can also use this to include 
the content of another resource to the response.
There are two methods defined in this interface:
1.void forward()
2.void include()
Q4. What are the differences between forward() method and 
sendRedirect() methods?
Forward() method - forward() sends the same request to another resource. 
forward() method works at server side. forward() method works within the server only.
SendRedirect() method - sendRedirect() method sends new request always 
because it uses the URL bar of the browser. sendRedirect() method works at client side. 
sendRedirect() method works within and outside the server.
Q5. What is the life-cycle of a servlet?
There are 5 stages in the lifecycle of a servlet:
1.	Servlet is loaded
2.	Servlet is instantiated
3.	Servlet is initialized
4.	Service the request
5.	Servlet is destroyed
Q6. How does cookies work in Servlets?
*	Cookies are text data sent by server to the client and it gets saved at the client 
local machine.
*	Servlet API provides cookies support through javax.servlet.http.Cookie class that 
implements Serializable and Cloneable interfaces.
*	HttpServletRequest getCookies() method is provided to get the array of Cookies 
from request, since there is no point of adding Cookie to request, there are no 
methods to set or add cookie to request.
*	Similarly HttpServletResponse addCookie(Cookie c) method is provided to attach 
cookie in response header, there are no getter methods for cookie.
Q7. What are the differences between ServletContext vs ServletConfig?
The difference between ServletContext and ServletConfig in Servlets JSP is in below

*	All servlets must implement the javax.servlet.Servlet interface, which defines 
servlet lifecycle methods. When implementing a generic service, we can extend 
the GenericServlet class provided with the Java Servlet API. The HttpServlet 
class provides methods, such as doGet() and doPost(), for handling HTTP-
specific services.
*	Most of the times, web applications are accessed using HTTP protocol and thats 
why we mostly extend HttpServlet class. Servlet API hierarchy is shown in below 
image.

Q2. What are the differences between Get and Post methods?
Get - Limited amount of data can be sent because data is sent in header. Not Secured 
because data is exposed in URL bar.  Can be bookmarked.  Idempotent.  It is more 
efficient and used than Post
Post - Large amount of data can be sent because data is sent in body. Secured 
because data is not exposed in URL bar. Cannot be bookmarked. Non-Idempotent. It is 
less efficient and used
Q3. What is Request Dispatcher?
RequestDispatcher interface is used to forward the request to another resource that can 
be HTML, JSP or another servlet in same application. We can also use this to include 
the content of another resource to the response.
There are two methods defined in this interface:
1.void forward()
2.void include()
Q4. What are the differences between forward() method and 
sendRedirect() methods?
Forward() method - forward() sends the same request to another resource. 
forward() method works at server side. forward() method works within the server only.
SendRedirect() method - sendRedirect() method sends new request always 
because it uses the URL bar of the browser. sendRedirect() method works at client side. 
sendRedirect() method works within and outside the server.
Q5. What is the life-cycle of a servlet?
There are 5 stages in the lifecycle of a servlet:
1.	Servlet is loaded
2.	Servlet is instantiated
3.	Servlet is initialized
4.	Service the request
5.	Servlet is destroyed
Q6. How does cookies work in Servlets?
*	Cookies are text data sent by server to the client and it gets saved at the client 
local machine.
*	Servlet API provides cookies support through javax.servlet.http.Cookie class that 
implements Serializable and Cloneable interfaces.
*	HttpServletRequest getCookies() method is provided to get the array of Cookies 
from request, since there is no point of adding Cookie to request, there are no 
methods to set or add cookie to request.
*	Similarly HttpServletResponse addCookie(Cookie c) method is provided to attach 
cookie in response header, there are no getter methods for cookie.
Q7. What are the differences between ServletContext vs ServletConfig?
The difference between ServletContext and ServletConfig in Servlets JSP is in below 
tabular format.
ServletConfig - Servlet config object represent single servlet. Its like local 
parameter associated with particular servlet. It's a name value pair defined inside the 
servlet section of web.xml file so it has servlet wide scope. getServletConfig() method is 
used to get the config object. for example shopping cart of a user is a specific to 
particular user so here we can use servlet config.
ServletContext - It represent whole web application running on particular JVM and 
common for all the servlet. Its like global parameter associated with whole application. 
ServletContext has application wide scope so define outside of servlet tag in web.xml 
file. getServletContext() method is  used to get the context object. To get the MIME type 
of a file or application session related information is stored using servlet context object
Q8. What are the different methods of session management in 
servlets?
Session is a conversational state between client and server and it can consists of 
multiple request and response between client and server. Since HTTP and Web Server 
both are stateless, the only way to maintain a session is when some unique information 
about the session (session id) is passed between server and client in every request and 
response.
Some of the common ways of session management in servlets are:
1.	User Authentication
2.	HTML Hidden Field
3.	Cookies
4.	URL Rewriting
5.	Session Management API

because it uses the URL bar of the browser. sendRedirect() method works at client side. 
sendRedirect() method works within and outside the server.
Q5. What is the life-cycle of a servlet?
There are 5 stages in the lifecycle of a servlet:
1.	Servlet is loaded
2.	Servlet is instantiated
3.	Servlet is initialized
4.	Service the request
5.	Servlet is destroyed
Q6. How does cookies work in Servlets?
*	Cookies are text data sent by server to the client and it gets saved at the client 
local machine.
*	Servlet API provides cookies support through javax.servlet.http.Cookie class that 
implements Serializable and Cloneable interfaces.
*	HttpServletRequest getCookies() method is provided to get the array of Cookies 
from request, since there is no point of adding Cookie to request, there are no 
methods to set or add cookie to request.
*	Similarly HttpServletResponse addCookie(Cookie c) method is provided to attach 
cookie in response header, there are no getter methods for cookie.
Q7. What are the differences between ServletContext vs ServletConfig?
The difference between ServletContext and ServletConfig in Servlets JSP is in below 
tabular format.
ServletConfig - Servlet config object represent single servlet. Its like local 
parameter associated with particular servlet. It's a name value pair defined inside the 
servlet section of web.xml file so it has servlet wide scope. getServletConfig() method is 
used to get the config object. for example shopping cart of a user is a specific to 
particular user so here we can use servlet config.
ServletContext - It represent whole web application running on particular JVM and 
common for all the servlet. Its like global parameter associated with whole application. 
ServletContext has application wide scope so define outside of servlet tag in web.xml 
file. getServletContext() method is  used to get the context object. To get the MIME type 
of a file or application session related information is stored using servlet context object
Q8. What are the different methods of session management in 
servlets?
Session is a conversational state between client and server and it can consists of 
multiple request and response between client and server. Since HTTP and Web Server 
both are stateless, the only way to maintain a session is when some unique information 
about the session (session id) is passed between server and client in every request and 
response.
Some of the common ways of session management in servlets are:
1.	User Authentication
2.	HTML Hidden Field
3.	Cookies
4.	URL Rewriting
5.	Session Management API































Servlets Interview Questions  
Q1. What is a servlet?
*	Java Servlet is server side technologies to extend the capability of web servers 
by providing support for dynamic response and data persistence.
*	The javax.servlet and javax.servlet.http packages provide interfaces and classes 
for writing our own servlets.
*	All servlets must implement the javax.servlet.Servlet interface, which defines 
servlet lifecycle methods. When implementing a generic service, we can extend 
the GenericServlet class provided with the Java Servlet API. The HttpServlet 
class provides methods, such as doGet() and doPost(), for handling HTTP-
specific services.
*	Most of the times, web applications are accessed using HTTP protocol and thats 
why we mostly extend HttpServlet class. Servlet API hierarchy is shown in below 
image.

Q2. What are the differences between Get and Post methods?
Get - Limited amount of data can be sent because data is sent in header. Not Secured 
because data is exposed in URL bar.  Can be bookmarked.  Idempotent.  It is more 
efficient and used than Post
Post - Large amount of data can be sent because data is sent in body. Secured 
because data is not exposed in URL bar. Cannot be bookmarked. Non-Idempotent. It is 
less efficient and used
Q3. What is Request Dispatcher?
RequestDispatcher interface is used to forward the request to another resource that can 
be HTML, JSP or another servlet in same application. We can also use this to include 
the content of another resource to the response.
There are two methods defined in this interface:
1.void forward()
2.void include()

ServletContext - It represent whole web application running on particular JVM and 
common for all the servlet. Its like global parameter associated with whole application. 
ServletContext has application wide scope so define outside of servlet tag in web.xml 
file. getServletContext() method is  used to get the context object. To get the MIME type 
of a file or application session related information is stored using servlet context object
Q8. What are the different methods of session management in 
servlets?
Session is a conversational state between client and server and it can consists of 
multiple request and response between client and server. Since HTTP and Web Server 
both are stateless, the only way to maintain a session is when some unique information 
about the session (session id) is passed between server and client in every request and 
response.
Some of the common ways of session management in servlets are:
1.	User Authentication
2.	HTML Hidden Field
3.	Cookies
4.	URL Rewriting
5.	Session Management API































Servlets Interview Questions  
Q1. What is a servlet?
*	Java Servlet is server side technologies to extend the capability of web servers 
by providing support for dynamic response and data persistence.
*	The javax.servlet and javax.servlet.http packages provide interfaces and classes 
for writing our own servlets.
*	All servlets must implement the javax.servlet.Servlet interface, which defines 
servlet lifecycle methods. When implementing a generic service, we can extend 
the GenericServlet class provided with the Java Servlet API. The HttpServlet 
class provides methods, such as doGet() and doPost(), for handling HTTP-
specific services.
*	Most of the times, web applications are accessed using HTTP protocol and thats 
why we mostly extend HttpServlet class. Servlet API hierarchy is shown in below 
image.

Q2. What are the differences between Get and Post methods?
Get - Limited amount of data can be sent because data is sent in header. Not Secured 
because data is exposed in URL bar.  Can be bookmarked.  Idempotent.  It is more 
efficient and used than Post
Post - Large amount of data can be sent because data is sent in body. Secured 
because data is not exposed in URL bar. Cannot be bookmarked. Non-Idempotent. It is 
less efficient and used
Q3. What is Request Dispatcher?
RequestDispatcher interface is used to forward the request to another resource that can 
be HTML, JSP or another servlet in same application. We can also use this to include 
the content of another resource to the response.
There are two methods defined in this interface:
1.void forward()
2.void include()
Q4. What are the differences between forward() method and 
sendRedirect() methods?
Forward() method - forward() sends the same request to another resource. 
forward() method works at server side. forward() method works within the server only.
SendRedirect() method - sendRedirect() method sends new request always 
because it uses the URL bar of the browser. sendRedirect() method works at client side. 
sendRedirect() method works within and outside the server.
Q5. What is the life-cycle of a servlet?
There are 5 stages in the lifecycle of a servlet:
1.	Servlet is loaded
2.	Servlet is instantiated
3.	Servlet is initialized
4.	Service the request
5.	Servlet is destroyed
Q6. How does cookies work in Servlets?
*	Cookies are text data sent by server to the client and it gets saved at the client 
local machine.
*	Servlet API provides cookies support through javax.servlet.http.Cookie class that 
implements Serializable and Cloneable interfaces.
*	HttpServletRequest getCookies() method is provided to get the array of Cookies 
from request, since there is no point of adding Cookie to request, there are no 
methods to set or add cookie to request.
*	Similarly HttpServletResponse addCookie(Cookie c) method is provided to attach 
cookie in response header, there are no getter methods for cookie.
Q7. What are the differences between ServletContext vs ServletConfig?
The difference between ServletContext and ServletConfig in Servlets JSP is in below 
tabular format.
ServletConfig - Servlet config object represent single servlet. Its like local 
parameter associated with particular servlet. It's a name value pair defined inside the 
servlet section of web.xml file so it has servlet wide scope. getServletConfig() method is 
used to get the config object. for example shopping cart of a user is a specific to 
particular user so here we can use servlet config.
ServletContext - It represent whole web application running on particular JVM and 
common for all the servlet. Its like global parameter associated with whole application.

class provides methods, such as doGet() and doPost(), for handling HTTP-
specific services.
*	Most of the times, web applications are accessed using HTTP protocol and thats 
why we mostly extend HttpServlet class. Servlet API hierarchy is shown in below 
image.

Q2. What are the differences between Get and Post methods?
Get - Limited amount of data can be sent because data is sent in header. Not Secured 
because data is exposed in URL bar.  Can be bookmarked.  Idempotent.  It is more 
efficient and used than Post
Post - Large amount of data can be sent because data is sent in body. Secured 
because data is not exposed in URL bar. Cannot be bookmarked. Non-Idempotent. It is 
less efficient and used
Q3. What is Request Dispatcher?
RequestDispatcher interface is used to forward the request to another resource that can 
be HTML, JSP or another servlet in same application. We can also use this to include 
the content of another resource to the response.
There are two methods defined in this interface:
1.void forward()
2.void include()
Q4. What are the differences between forward() method and 
sendRedirect() methods?
Forward() method - forward() sends the same request to another resource. 
forward() method works at server side. forward() method works within the server only.
SendRedirect() method - sendRedirect() method sends new request always 
because it uses the URL bar of the browser. sendRedirect() method works at client side. 
sendRedirect() method works within and outside the server.
Q5. What is the life-cycle of a servlet?
There are 5 stages in the lifecycle of a servlet:
1.	Servlet is loaded
2.	Servlet is instantiated
3.	Servlet is initialized
4.	Service the request
5.	Servlet is destroyed
Q6. How does cookies work in Servlets?
*	Cookies are text data sent by server to the client and it gets saved at the client 
local machine.
*	Servlet API provides cookies support through javax.servlet.http.Cookie class that 
implements Serializable and Cloneable interfaces.
*	HttpServletRequest getCookies() method is provided to get the array of Cookies 
from request, since there is no point of adding Cookie to request, there are no 
methods to set or add cookie to request.
*	Similarly HttpServletResponse addCookie(Cookie c) method is provided to attach 
cookie in response header, there are no getter methods for cookie.
Q7. What are the differences between ServletContext vs ServletConfig?
The difference between ServletContext and ServletConfig in Servlets JSP is in below 
tabular format.
ServletConfig - Servlet config object represent single servlet. Its like local 
parameter associated with particular servlet. It's a name value pair defined inside the 
servlet section of web.xml file so it has servlet wide scope. getServletConfig() method is 
used to get the config object. for example shopping cart of a user is a specific to 
particular user so here we can use servlet config.
ServletContext - It represent whole web application running on particular JVM and 
common for all the servlet. Its like global parameter associated with whole application. 
ServletContext has application wide scope so define outside of servlet tag in web.xml 
file. getServletContext() method is  used to get the context object. To get the MIME type 
of a file or application session related information is stored using servlet context object
Q8. What are the different methods of session management in 
servlets?
Session is a conversational state between client and server and it can consists of 
multiple request and response between client and server. Since HTTP and Web Server 
both are stateless, the only way to maintain a session is when some unique information 
about the session (session id) is passed between server and client in every request and 
response.
Some of the common ways of session management in servlets are:
1.	User Authentication
2.	HTML Hidden Field
3.	Cookies
4.	URL Rewriting
5.	Session Management API

Q1. What is a servlet?
*	Java Servlet is server side technologies to extend the capability of web servers 
by providing support for dynamic response and data persistence.
*	The javax.servlet and javax.servlet.http packages provide interfaces and classes 
for writing our own servlets.
*	All servlets must implement the javax.servlet.Servlet interface, which defines 
servlet lifecycle methods. When implementing a generic service, we can extend
