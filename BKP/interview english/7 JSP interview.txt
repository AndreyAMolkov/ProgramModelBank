Java Interview Questions: JSP
Q1. What are the life-cycle methods for a jsp?
Method public void jspInit() - It is invoked only once, same as init method of servlet.
Method - public void _jspService(ServletRequest request,ServletResponse)throws 
ServletException,IOException - It is invoked at each request, same as service() method 
of servlet.
Method - public void jspDestroy() - It is invoked only once, same as destroy() method of 
servlet.

Q2. What are the JSP implicit objects?
JSP provides 9 implicit objects by default. They are as follows:
Object
Type
1) out -  JspWriter
2) request -  HttpServletRequest
3) response -  HttpServletResponse
4) config -  ServletConfig
5) session -  HttpSession
6) application -  ServletContext
7) pageContext - PageContext
8) page -  Object
9) exception - Throwable

Q3. What are the differences between include directive and 
include action?
include directive - The include directive includes the content at page translation time. 
The include directive includes the original content of the page so page size increases at 
runtime. It's better for static pages.
include action - The include action includes the content at request time. The include 
action doesn't include the original content rather invokes the include() method of Vendor 
provided class. It's better for dynamic pages.

Q4. How to disable caching on back button of the browser?
<% 
response.setHeader("Cache-Control","no-store"); 
response.setHeader("Pragma","no-cache"); 
response.setHeader ("Expires", "0");                    //prevents caching at the proxy server 
%>   
Q5. What are the different tags provided in JSTL?
There are 5 type of JSTL tags.
1.	core tags
2.	sql tags
3.	xml tags
4.	internationalization tags
5.	functions tags

Q6. How to disable session in JSP?
1.	<%@ page session="false" %>  
 
Q7.  How to delete a Cookie in a JSP?
The following code explain how to delete a Cookie in a JSP :

Cookie mycook = new Cookie("name1","value1");
 
response.addCookie(mycook1);
 
Cookie killmycook = new Cookie("mycook1","value1");
 
killmycook . set MaxAge ( 0 );
 
killmycook . set Path ("/");
 
killmycook . addCookie ( killmycook 1 );
Q8. Explain the jspDestroy() method.
jspDestry() method is invoked from javax.servlet.jsp.JspPage interface whenever a JSP 
page is about to be destroyed. Servlets destroy methods can be easily overridden to 
perform cleanup, like when closing a database connection.
Q9.  How is JSP better than Servlet technology?
JSP is a technology on the server's side to make content generation simple. They are 
document centric, whereas servlets are programs. A Java server page can contain 
fragments of Java program, which execute and instantiate Java classes. However, they 
occur inside HTML template file. It provides the framework for development of a Web 
Application.
Q10. Why should we not configure JSP standard tags in 
web.xml?
We don't need to configure JSP standard tags in web.xml because when container 
loads the web application and find TLD files, it automatically configures them to be used 
directly in the application JSP pages. We just need to include it in the JSP page using 
taglib directive.

Q10. Why should we not configure JSP standard tags in 
web.xml?
We don't need to configure JSP standard tags in web.xml because when container 
loads the web application and find TLD files, it automatically configures them to be used 
directly in the application JSP pages. We just need to include it in the JSP page using 
taglib directive.































Java Interview Questions: JSP
Q1. What are the life-cycle methods for a jsp?
Method public void jspInit() - It is invoked only once, same as init method of servlet.
Method - public void _jspService(ServletRequest request,ServletResponse)throws 
ServletException,IOException - It is invoked at each request, same as service() method 
of servlet.
Method - public void jspDestroy() - It is invoked only once, same as destroy() method of 
servlet.

Q2. What are the JSP implicit objects?
JSP provides 9 implicit objects by default. They are as follows:
Object
Type
1) out -  JspWriter
2) request -  HttpServletRequest
3) response -  HttpServletResponse
4) config -  ServletConfig
5) session -  HttpSession
6) application -  ServletContext
7) pageContext - PageContext
8) page -  Object
9) exception - Throwable

Q3. What are the differences between include directive and 
include action?
include directive - The include directive includes the content at page translation time. 
The include directive includes the original content of the page so page size increases at 
runtime. It's better for static pages.
include action - The include action includes the content at request time. The include 
action doesn't include the original content rather invokes the include() method of Vendor 
provided class. It's better for dynamic pages.

Q4. How to disable caching on back button of the browser?
<% 
response.setHeader("Cache-Control","no-store"); 
response.setHeader("Pragma","no-cache"); 
response.setHeader ("Expires", "0");                    //prevents caching at the proxy server 
%>   
Q5. What are the different tags provided in JSTL?
There are 5 type of JSTL tags.
1.	core tags
2.	sql tags
3.	xml tags
4.	internationalization tags
5.	functions tags

Q6. How to disable session in JSP?
1.	<%@ page session="false" %>  
 
Q7.  How to delete a Cookie in a JSP?
The following code explain how to delete a Cookie in a JSP :

Cookie mycook = new Cookie("name1","value1");
 
response.addCookie(mycook1);
 
Cookie killmycook = new Cookie("mycook1","value1");
 
killmycook . set MaxAge ( 0 );
 
killmycook . set Path ("/");
 
killmycook . addCookie ( killmycook 1 );
Q8. Explain the jspDestroy() method.
jspDestry() method is invoked from javax.servlet.jsp.JspPage interface whenever a JSP 
page is about to be destroyed. Servlets destroy methods can be easily overridden to 
perform cleanup, like when closing a database connection.
Q9.  How is JSP better than Servlet technology?
JSP is a technology on the server's side to make content generation simple. They are 
document centric, whereas servlets are programs. A Java server page can contain 
fragments of Java program, which execute and instantiate Java classes. However, they 
occur inside HTML template file. It provides the framework for development of a Web 
Application.
Q10. Why should we not configure JSP standard tags in

perform cleanup, like when closing a database connection.
Q9.  How is JSP better than Servlet technology?
JSP is a technology on the server's side to make content generation simple. They are 
document centric, whereas servlets are programs. A Java server page can contain 
fragments of Java program, which execute and instantiate Java classes. However, they 
occur inside HTML template file. It provides the framework for development of a Web 
Application.
Q10. Why should we not configure JSP standard tags in 
web.xml?
We don't need to configure JSP standard tags in web.xml because when container 
loads the web application and find TLD files, it automatically configures them to be used 
directly in the application JSP pages. We just need to include it in the JSP page using 
taglib directive.































Java Interview Questions: JSP
Q1. What are the life-cycle methods for a jsp?
Method public void jspInit() - It is invoked only once, same as init method of servlet.
Method - public void _jspService(ServletRequest request,ServletResponse)throws 
ServletException,IOException - It is invoked at each request, same as service() method 
of servlet.
Method - public void jspDestroy() - It is invoked only once, same as destroy() method of 
servlet.

Q2. What are the JSP implicit objects?
JSP provides 9 implicit objects by default. They are as follows:
Object
Type
1) out -  JspWriter
2) request -  HttpServletRequest
3) response -  HttpServletResponse
4) config -  ServletConfig
5) session -  HttpSession
6) application -  ServletContext
7) pageContext - PageContext
8) page -  Object
9) exception - Throwable

Q3. What are the differences between include directive and 
include action?
include directive - The include directive includes the content at page translation time. 
The include directive includes the original content of the page so page size increases at 
runtime. It's better for static pages.
include action - The include action includes the content at request time. The include 
action doesn't include the original content rather invokes the include() method of Vendor 
provided class. It's better for dynamic pages.

Q4. How to disable caching on back button of the browser?
<% 
response.setHeader("Cache-Control","no-store"); 
response.setHeader("Pragma","no-cache"); 
response.setHeader ("Expires", "0");                    //prevents caching at the proxy server 
%>   
Q5. What are the different tags provided in JSTL?
There are 5 type of JSTL tags.
1.	core tags
2.	sql tags
3.	xml tags
4.	internationalization tags
5.	functions tags

Q6. How to disable session in JSP?
1.	<%@ page session="false" %>  
 
Q7.  How to delete a Cookie in a JSP?
The following code explain how to delete a Cookie in a JSP :

Cookie mycook = new Cookie("name1","value1");
 
response.addCookie(mycook1);
 
Cookie killmycook = new Cookie("mycook1","value1");
 
killmycook . set MaxAge ( 0 );
 
killmycook . set Path ("/");
 
killmycook . addCookie ( killmycook 1 );

response.addCookie(mycook1);
 
Cookie killmycook = new Cookie("mycook1","value1");
 
killmycook . set MaxAge ( 0 );
 
killmycook . set Path ("/");
 
killmycook . addCookie ( killmycook 1 );
Q8. Explain the jspDestroy() method.
jspDestry() method is invoked from javax.servlet.jsp.JspPage interface whenever a JSP 
page is about to be destroyed. Servlets destroy methods can be easily overridden to 
perform cleanup, like when closing a database connection.
Q9.  How is JSP better than Servlet technology?
JSP is a technology on the server's side to make content generation simple. They are 
document centric, whereas servlets are programs. A Java server page can contain 
fragments of Java program, which execute and instantiate Java classes. However, they 
occur inside HTML template file. It provides the framework for development of a Web 
Application.
Q10. Why should we not configure JSP standard tags in 
web.xml?
We don't need to configure JSP standard tags in web.xml because when container 
loads the web application and find TLD files, it automatically configures them to be used 
directly in the application JSP pages. We just need to include it in the JSP page using 
taglib directive.































Java Interview Questions: JSP
Q1. What are the life-cycle methods for a jsp?
Method public void jspInit() - It is invoked only once, same as init method of servlet.
Method - public void _jspService(ServletRequest request,ServletResponse)throws 
ServletException,IOException - It is invoked at each request, same as service() method 
of servlet.
Method - public void jspDestroy() - It is invoked only once, same as destroy() method of 
servlet.

Q2. What are the JSP implicit objects?
JSP provides 9 implicit objects by default. They are as follows:
Object
Type
1) out -  JspWriter
2) request -  HttpServletRequest
3) response -  HttpServletResponse
4) config -  ServletConfig
5) session -  HttpSession
6) application -  ServletContext
7) pageContext - PageContext
8) page -  Object
9) exception - Throwable

Q3. What are the differences between include directive and 
include action?
include directive - The include directive includes the content at page translation time. 
The include directive includes the original content of the page so page size increases at 
runtime. It's better for static pages.
include action - The include action includes the content at request time. The include 
action doesn't include the original content rather invokes the include() method of Vendor 
provided class. It's better for dynamic pages.

Q4. How to disable caching on back button of the browser?
<% 
response.setHeader("Cache-Control","no-store"); 
response.setHeader("Pragma","no-cache"); 
response.setHeader ("Expires", "0");                    //prevents caching at the proxy server 
%>   
Q5. What are the different tags provided in JSTL?
There are 5 type of JSTL tags.
1.	core tags
2.	sql tags
3.	xml tags
4.	internationalization tags
5.	functions tags

Q6. How to disable session in JSP?
1.	<%@ page session="false" %>

1.	core tags
2.	sql tags
3.	xml tags
4.	internationalization tags
5.	functions tags

Q6. How to disable session in JSP?
1.	<%@ page session="false" %>  
 
Q7.  How to delete a Cookie in a JSP?
The following code explain how to delete a Cookie in a JSP :

Cookie mycook = new Cookie("name1","value1");
 
response.addCookie(mycook1);
 
Cookie killmycook = new Cookie("mycook1","value1");
 
killmycook . set MaxAge ( 0 );
 
killmycook . set Path ("/");
 
killmycook . addCookie ( killmycook 1 );
Q8. Explain the jspDestroy() method.
jspDestry() method is invoked from javax.servlet.jsp.JspPage interface whenever a JSP 
page is about to be destroyed. Servlets destroy methods can be easily overridden to 
perform cleanup, like when closing a database connection.
Q9.  How is JSP better than Servlet technology?
JSP is a technology on the server's side to make content generation simple. They are 
document centric, whereas servlets are programs. A Java server page can contain 
fragments of Java program, which execute and instantiate Java classes. However, they 
occur inside HTML template file. It provides the framework for development of a Web 
Application.
Q10. Why should we not configure JSP standard tags in 
web.xml?
We don't need to configure JSP standard tags in web.xml because when container 
loads the web application and find TLD files, it automatically configures them to be used 
directly in the application JSP pages. We just need to include it in the JSP page using 
taglib directive.































Java Interview Questions: JSP
Q1. What are the life-cycle methods for a jsp?
Method public void jspInit() - It is invoked only once, same as init method of servlet.
Method - public void _jspService(ServletRequest request,ServletResponse)throws 
ServletException,IOException - It is invoked at each request, same as service() method 
of servlet.
Method - public void jspDestroy() - It is invoked only once, same as destroy() method of 
servlet.

Q2. What are the JSP implicit objects?
JSP provides 9 implicit objects by default. They are as follows:
Object
Type
1) out -  JspWriter
2) request -  HttpServletRequest
3) response -  HttpServletResponse
4) config -  ServletConfig
5) session -  HttpSession
6) application -  ServletContext
7) pageContext - PageContext
8) page -  Object
9) exception - Throwable

Q3. What are the differences between include directive and 
include action?
include directive - The include directive includes the content at page translation time. 
The include directive includes the original content of the page so page size increases at 
runtime. It's better for static pages.
include action - The include action includes the content at request time. The include 
action doesn't include the original content rather invokes the include() method of Vendor 
provided class. It's better for dynamic pages.

Q4. How to disable caching on back button of the browser?
<% 
response.setHeader("Cache-Control","no-store"); 
response.setHeader("Pragma","no-cache"); 
response.setHeader ("Expires", "0");                    //prevents caching at the proxy server 
%>
